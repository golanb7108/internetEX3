1. What was hard?
    learning the correct way to use ajax was the most tricky part in this ex.
	Once learning it - the implementation was fluid.
2. What was easy?
    Handling the UI was kind of easy - mainly the static html.
3. About the course:
   The course definitely introduces one to the newest internet technologies.
   I think that the difficulty of the course is needed - the ex's really make you know 
   each of the topics learned.
